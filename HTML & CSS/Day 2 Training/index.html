        <p>A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers.
           Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.</p>
  
        <p>In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the US) and secondary (middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may
           be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance.
            Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.</p>

        <p>Non-government schools, also known as private schools,[3] may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or specific educational needs. 
          Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements.
           Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools..</p>
      </aside>

      <p>In homeschooling and distance education, 
        teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building respectively.
         Schools are commonly organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and 
         schools-within-a-school.</p>
