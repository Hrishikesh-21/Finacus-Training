                    The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since Classical antiquity. Formal schools have existed 
                    at least since ancient Greece (see Academy), ancient Rome (see Education in Ancient Rome) 
                    ancient India (see Gurukul), and ancient China (see History of education in China). 
                    The Byzantine Empire had an established schooling system beginning at the primary level.
                     According to Traditions and Encounters, the founding of the primary education system began in 425 AD and "... military personnel usually
                      had at least a primary education ...". The sometimes efficient and often large government of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must.
                       Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of Roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals. 
                       The Byzantine education system continued until the empire's collapse in 1453 AD.[11]

                    In Western Europe a considerable number of cathedral schools were
                    founded during the Early Middle Ages in order to teach future clergy and administrators,
                    with the oldest still existing, and continuously operated, cathedral schools being The King's School,
                    Canterbury (established 597 CE), King's School, Rochester (established 604 CE), St Peter's School, 
                    York (established 627 CE) and Thetford Grammar School (established 631 CE). Beginning in the 5th century CE monastic schools were also
                    established throughout Western Europe, teaching both religious and secular subjects.
